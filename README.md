As part of The Odin Project, this is my code working alongside the MDN tutorials: through the Strings exercises and the Conditionals exercises. Initially for Strings, I used the js scripts within the HTML but then created an index.html for the rest of the exercises (conditionals1-4.js). Replace the src in index.html to view the solution of the 4 'Conditionals' exercises.

Disclaimer: it may not be clean code
